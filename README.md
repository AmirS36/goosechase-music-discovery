# 🎵 GooseChase — AI-Powered Music Discovery App

GooseChase is a music discovery app that learns your taste by showing you short 20-second song previews based on your preferences. You react by swiping left or right to express how you feel about the song. Behind the scenes, we use Spotify data, user feedback, and AI to recommend better songs over time.
